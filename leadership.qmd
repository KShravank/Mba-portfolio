## Leadership Philosophy

My leadership approach is shaped by **collaboration, clarity, and data-informed decision-making**.  
I believe that effective leadership—especially in analytics and operations—comes from helping teams understand the problem clearly, aligning expectations early, and communicating insights in a way that people can act on.  
This reflects elements of **servant leadership** (supporting others’ success), **situational leadership** (adapting to team needs), and **evidence-based leadership** (using data to guide decisions).

## Leadership in Professional Settings

### Cross-Functional Coordination as a Business Analyst (VMware)

In my Business Analyst role, leadership meant **driving clarity in fast-moving environments**:

- Served as a **bridge between project management, account management, and finance**, ensuring consistent and reliable numbers across teams.  
- Took ownership of **QBR timelines**, coordinating data extraction, KPI validation, performance commentary, and slide preparation before leadership and client review calls.  
- Exercised analytical leadership by escalating risks early when data reflected **declining usage, rising refunds, performance bottlenecks, or renewal risks**, enabling teams to take timely corrective action.  
- Demonstrated **stakeholder leadership** by translating complex operational patterns into simple, decision-ready insights.

This experience taught me to lead without formal authority—by influencing through data, structure, reliability, and communication.

## Leadership in Academic Projects

### Team Leadership in the MBA Program

Working with multicultural teams at UCW helped strengthen my interpersonal and collaborative leadership:

- Often stepped into the role of **structured problem-solver**, helping teams define the scope, outline deliverables, and sequence the work.  
- Took responsibility for organizing **data, research, and slides** so the final presentation told a cohesive and professional story.  
- Practiced inclusive leadership by encouraging quieter team members to contribute, summarizing discussions, and checking for shared understanding.  
- Used conflict-free decision-making by focusing the team on **criteria, evidence, and clarity**, rather than personal opinions.

These experiences reinforced the value of empathy, active listening, and cultural awareness in team settings.

## Leading with Data and Emerging Technologies

I view modern leadership as the ability to combine **analytics, technology, and human judgment**:

- Learned to use data not only for reporting but to **guide decisions**, identify risks, and shape conversations.  
- Working with LLMs in academic assignments strengthened my ability to **evaluate AI outputs critically**, verify facts, and differentiate between computational accuracy and real-world practicality.  
- Developed the habit of explaining insights in terms of **trade-offs**, assumptions, and limitations—an essential part of responsible analytical leadership.

This mindset supports my long-term goal: becoming a leader who uses analytics and AI ethically, transparently, and effectively.

## Growth Priorities as a Developing Leader

- Gaining deeper exposure to **supply chain and operational environments in Canada**, building on my foundation in analytics and account support.  
- Continuing to develop skills in **ethical AI use**, especially fairness, transparency, and inclusivity in data-driven decisions.  
- Building confidence in **strategic communication**, ensuring that insights not only inform but drive meaningful action among managers and clients.
