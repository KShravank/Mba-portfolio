# Appendix A — LLM-Generated Drafts

The following content includes *unedited* drafts generated using ChatGPT during the brainstorming stage of Assignment 3. These drafts were **not** used verbatim in my final website.  
Instead, I critically reviewed, fact-checked, and revised each section to reflect my real experience and maintain academic integrity.

## A1. Initial LLM Draft for Website Structure

**Prompt Used:**  
“Generate a multi-page MBA portfolio website outline for a Quarto project. Include Home, Resume, Projects, Skills, Leadership, and Contact pages.”

**LLM Output (Raw):**

- Home/About section with biography and links  
- Resume page with education, professional experience, and skills  
- Projects page with academic and professional project summaries  
- Skills page with technical skills, soft skills, and tools  
- Leadership page with leadership philosophy and teamwork examples  
- Contact page with email, LinkedIn, and résumé download link

(This output was used only to determine *page structure*. The actual content on my website was fully rewritten.)

- Interested in digital transformation, innovation, and data-driven decision making.  
- Enjoys teamwork and contributes to collaborative learning environments.

**Revision Notes:**

- AI-assisted drafting + human revision

# Appendix B — Summary of Revisions & Academic Integrity Notes

## B1. How LLMs Were Used

I used LLMs (ChatGPT) to:

- brainstorm ideas  
- generate draft outlines  
- produce first-pass text for some sections  
- assist with formatting and structure  

LLMs were **not** used to produce final content.

## B2. How I Ensured Accuracy

All final content was:

- fact-checked  
- rewritten in my own words  
- aligned to my actual work experience (VMware, Urban Ladder, etc.)  
- revised to match MBA-level expectations  
- reviewed for clarity and professionalism  

## B3. Ethical Use of AI

I followed academic honesty guidelines:

- No copy-pasting of unedited LLM text  
- All LLM drafts are disclosed in this appendix  
- All final text is original and written by me  
- I corrected inaccuracies and removed generic statements  

## B4. Reflection on LLM Limitations

Through this project, I learned that LLMs:

- generate helpful structure, but lack contextual precision  
- can produce generic or inaccurate descriptions of my experience  
- require human judgment for accuracy, tone, and meaning  
- work best as brainstorming tools, not content creators  

This aligns with course teachings on responsible AI use.
