    "text": "title: Reflection- Using LI,LLMs in My MBA portfolio Website. page-layout: full\nThe use of large language models (LLMs) in this assignment developed over the time of this assignment in the form of straight-forward drafting assistance rather than a more deliberate cooperation. Initially, I mainly used the model to work out the structure that my portfolio would have and to come up with rough copies of different pages like the Home and Skills pages of my portfolio. The LLM particularly proved useful in bringing disjointed ideas in a coherent outline and proposing headings, phrases and transitions that I could edit.\nThe more pages I added the more critical and selective I became with my use of AI-generated text. I also understood that when direct copying of the drafts was made, the site would be generic and will not be representative of my real life experience as a Business Analyst who is dealing with QBRs, dashboards and operations reporting. Rather, I began using the LLM output in a starting point. On each page, I posed three questions: “Is this really true?”, “Do I really sound like this?”, and, would I be comfortable making this description before a job interviewer? It was no in the initial cases on many occasions, compelling me to revise, cut and rewrite.\nAnother lesson was the one of actuality and proper application. I ensured that no sensitive information of the company was exchanged with the model and that samples were of high level or anonymised. I have also made it clear through the appendix where I used the LLMs and how I edited their drafts. This openness is important to me as it demonstrates that the site is not fancying itself as being purely human work, but is not placebl-ing AI either.\nAll in all, the development of a design of a multi-page website with the assistance of LLM enhanced my technical and reflective abilities. Technologically, I was taught to work with various, .qmd files, navigation, and GitHub Pages hosting. Reflectively, I have acquired a better understanding of my own voice and professional narrative through editing and at times disagreeing with the model. In the future, I will consider LLMs as facilitative tools mainly when brainstorming and drafting the initial text, yet I will keep up to the office hours to adopt my own judgment in making sure that the final product is accurate, responsible, as well as in line with my identity."

    "text": "About Me\nI am an MBA candidate at University Canada West with experience as a Business Analyst supporting account management and project management teams. In my previous role, I worked closely with global clients to build dashboards, support quarterly business reviews (QBRs), and prepare billing and reconciliation reports that gave stakeholders a clear view of performance and revenue.\nI enjoy turning messy operational data into simple stories that decision-makers can act on. My work usually sits at the intersection of analytics, operations, and client communication – understanding what leaders need to see, structuring the numbers, and presenting insights clearly.\nSince moving to Canada, I have been expanding my skills in AI applications, data visualization, and digital workflows so I can contribute to data-informed, technology-enabled finance and operations teams."
