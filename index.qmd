## About

Numbers don’t have to be chaotic. I design calm, reliable finance workflows—clear reconciliations, tidy documentation, and reporting you can trust. I’m an MBA candidate at UCW with hands-on experience in busy finance teams, and I enjoy the mix of analysis, operations, and practical problem-solving.

Right now I’m looking for roles where I can keep the books clean, the process simple, and the team moving.
