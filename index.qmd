## About Me

I am an MBA candidate at University Canada West with experience as a **Business Analyst** supporting account management and project management teams. In my previous role, I worked closely with global clients to build **dashboards**, support **quarterly business reviews (QBRs)**, and prepare **billing and reconciliation reports** that gave stakeholders a clear view of performance and revenue.

I enjoy turning messy operational data into simple stories that decision-makers can act on. My work usually sits at the intersection of **analytics, operations, and client communication** – understanding what leaders need to see, structuring the numbers, and presenting insights clearly.

Since moving to Canada, I have been expanding my skills in **AI applications, data visualization, and digital workflows** so I can contribute to data-informed, technology-enabled finance and operations teams.

- **Billing & Reconciliation:** preparing billing files, checking variances, reconciling data across systems.  
- **Process Thinking:** understanding data flows across sales, delivery, and finance teams.
