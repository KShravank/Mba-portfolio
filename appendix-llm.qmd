# Introduction

This appendix accompanies my one-page MBA Portfolio website developed using Quarto and Markdown. The portfolio demonstrates how AI tools (like ChatGPT) can assist in professional content creation and digital publishing, followed by personal revisions and fact-checking to ensure authenticity and accuracy.

The appendix includes:
- The LLM-generated outline and text (verbatim).
- A brief commentary on the revisions made and why.
# Appendix — LLM Draft & Commentary

**Prompt used:**  
“Create an outline and sample text for a one-page MBA student portfolio.”

**LLM Output (verbatim):**  
<paste the model’s outline + sample text here, unchanged>

**My Commentary (what I used/changed and why):**
- Kept the section order but cut verbose parts to fit one page.
- Rewrote the bio and bullets to reflect my actual roles/results.
- Replaced generic skills with specific tools I use.
- Adjusted tone to be more concise and action-oriented.
- Ensured no claims are exaggerated; all facts are accurate.
