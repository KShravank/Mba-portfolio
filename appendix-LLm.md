# Appendix — LLM Draft & Commentary

**Prompt used:**  
“Create an outline and sample text for a one-page MBA student portfolio.”

**LLM Output (verbatim):**  
<paste the model’s outline + sample text here, unchanged>

**My Commentary (what I used/changed and why):**
- Kept the section order but cut verbose parts to fit one page.
- Rewrote the bio and bullets to reflect my actual roles/results.
- Replaced generic skills with specific tools I use.
- Adjusted tone to be more concise and action-oriented.
- Ensured no claims are exaggerated; all facts are accurate.
